        <h1>Semantic HTML: What It Is and How to Use It Correctly</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Semantic HTML plays a crucial role in web development, providing meaning to the web content beyond the
            presentation layer. This article explores the core benefits of using semantic elements.

        <h2>Improved Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            By using elements like header, nav, and footer, developers can create more accessible websites for people
            using screen readers and other assistive technologies.
        </p>
        <h2>SEO Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Semantic markup improves the SEO of web pages by allowing search engines to better understand the
            content structure, leading to potentially higher rankings in search results.

        <h2>Ease of Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
            Using semantic elements makes it easier for developers to read and maintain code, as the structure of the
            document is clearer and more intuitive.
        </p>
        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
        <p>
            The article element can be used independently of the rest of the web page content, making it ideal for blog
            posts, news articles, and more
